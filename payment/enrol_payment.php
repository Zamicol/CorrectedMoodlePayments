 * This plugin is meant to do the payment processing and enrolment managing 
 * associated with the payment for courses -- i.e. if you do not pay $X.xx
 * for the course, then you cannot take the course. Currently, it would appear
 * that the best way to implement this functionality is to drop non-paying users
 * down to guest access. This will require that teachers not disable guest
 * enrolment.
